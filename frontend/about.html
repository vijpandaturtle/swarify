    In India, the meaning of alankar or alankara is ornaments or adornments.  In the context of Indian classical music, the application of an alankar is essentially to embellish or enhance the inherent beauty of the genre. 
    It is said by many maestros of Indian Classical Music that mastery of alankars is key to becoming a good musician. However, these fundamentals are not given enough importance in a conventional music education. After a certain point, it also becomes difficult to come up with your own alankars without spending a lot of time and effort on it. 
    This app is designed to help you with your creative process by generating alankars with varying levels of difficulty. This way you can jumpstart your alankar practice, until it becomes second nature to you.
